Normalizing to a control like "No Cell Control" is a common approach to account for experimental variability and to enable more accurate comparisons across different conditions. Given the nature of this adsorption assay, where the "No Cell Control" serves as a baseline for phage titers in the absence of cell binding, several normalization strategies can be considered:

### Strategies for Normalization to "No Cell Control":

1. **Direct Subtraction**: Subtract the average titer value of the "No Cell Control" from each of the titer values for the other genotypes. This would provide a measure of the "excess" titer relative to the control.

    \[
    \text{Normalized Titer}_{\text{Direct}} = \text{Titer}_{\text{Genotype}} - \text{Average Titer}_{\text{"No Cell Control"}}
    \]


3. **Ratio Normalization**: Divide the titer value of each genotype by the average titer value of the "No Cell Control."

    \[
    \text{Normalized Titer}_{\text{Ratio}} = \frac{\text{Titer}_{\text{Genotype}}}{\text{Average Titer}_{\text{"No Cell Control"}}}
    \]

4. **Z-Score Normalization**: Calculate the Z-score based on the mean and standard deviation of the "No Cell Control" titer values.

    \[
    \text{Normalized Titer}_{\text{Z-score}} = \frac{\text{Titer}_{\text{Genotype}} - \text{Mean Titer}_{\text{"No Cell Control"}}}{\text{Std Dev}_{\text{"No Cell Control"}}}
    \]

### Factors to Consider:

- **Day-to-Day Variability**: Since the "No Cell Control" is run alongside each unique ID, it would be advantageous to use the day-specific "No Cell Control" values for normalization.
  
- **Biological Replicates**: If different biological replicates of the "No Cell Control" exhibit variability, this must be accounted for in the normalization process.

lets normalize the data using 3 methods. Direct subtraction, ratio normalization, and z score normalization. all of these will tkae into account the mean of the titer of the no cell control with the corresponding unique id does that make sense ?
