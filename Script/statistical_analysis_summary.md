# Statistical Testing Summary

## Independent t-tests

We performed independent t-tests between the different genotypes for the original titer values, 
direct subtraction normalized values, and ratio normalized values. Below are the summarized results for these comparisons:

### For Original Titer Values

- **NA1000 vs. NA1000 ▲pilA**: \( t = -0.51, p = 0.61 \)
- **NA1000 vs. bNY30a**: \( t = 10.71, p < 0.001 \)
- **NA1000 vs. pilAT36C**: \( t = 8.35, p < 0.001 \)
- **NA1000 vs. No Cell Control**: \( t = -4.95, p < 0.001 \)
- ...

### For Direct Subtraction Normalized Values

- **NA1000 vs. NA1000 ▲pilA**: \( t = -0.53, p = 0.60 \)
- **NA1000 vs. bNY30a**: \( t = 12.98, p < 0.001 \)
- **NA1000 vs. pilAT36C**: \( t = 12.74, p < 0.001 \)
- **NA1000 vs. No Cell Control**: \( t = -3.49, p = 0.0027 \)
- ...

### For Ratio Normalized Values

- **NA1000 vs. NA1000 ▲pilA**: \( t = -0.52, p = 0.61 \)
- **NA1000 vs. bNY30a**: \( t = 11.99, p < 0.001 \)
- **NA1000 vs. pilAT36C**: \( t = 11.66, p < 0.001 \)
- **NA1000 vs. No Cell Control**: \( t = -3.54, p = 0.0029 \)
- ...

These t-tests were performed using Welch's t-test for the assumption of unequal variances. The p-values reported are two-tailed.

## Observations and Interpretations

1. **Original Titer Values**: Significant differences were observed between the genotype NA1000 and the other genotypes (bNY30a, pilAT36C, and No Cell Control). The p-values were below 0.001, suggesting strong evidence against the null hypothesis of equal means.
  
2. **Direct Subtraction Normalized Values**: Similar trends were observed as with the original titer values. The normalization did not drastically change the significance levels between different genotypes.

3. **Ratio Normalized Values**: Again, the normalization seems consistent with the original titer values in terms of statistical significance.

In summary, these statistical tests suggest that there are significant differences between the genotypes in terms of their titers. The normalization techniques employed (direct subtraction and ratio normalization) do not dramatically change these conclusions, suggesting that the intrinsic variability between genotypes is robust to these normalization methods.
